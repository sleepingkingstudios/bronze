# Bronze

A set of objects and tools for building composable applications without the conceptual overhead of common frameworks. Allows the developer to incorporate other architectures by composition without forcing foreign constraints on your business logic.

## Support

Bronze and Patina are tested against Ruby 2.3.

### A Note From The Developer

Hi, I'm Rob Smith, a Ruby Engineer and the developer of this library. I use these tools every day, but they're not just written for me. If you find this project helpful in your own work, or if you have any questions, suggestions or critiques, please feel free to get in touch! I can be reached on GitHub (see above, and feel encouraged to submit bug reports or merge requests there) or via email at merlin@sleepingkingstudios.com. I look forward to hearing from you!

### Why Bronze and Patina?

Mainly symbolism. In metallurgy, bronze is an alloy composed chiefly of copper and tin and known since antiquity. The Bronze gem incorporates influences from different sources, and it is combination of ingredients that (hopefully) form a harmonious whole. As such, an alloy (a mixture of different metals and elements) is metaphorically apt. Copper alloys including bronze and brass have been used since antiquity in projects large and small, from arrowheads and chariots to great wonders such as the Colossus of Rhodes and the Statue of Liberty.

A patina is the surface layer of aged copper that gives the metal its distinctive green coloration, as well protection from corrosion and weathering. The Patina gem provides a finishing layer of additional functionality and features to developers using the Bronze framework.

### Dedication

This project is dedicated to my grandfather, who taught me the joy of flight.

## Bronze Features

The Bronze gem provides the core tools and objects for building an application. Wherever possible, these tools can be used on their own as part of another framework or project - use as much or as little as you want.

## Patina Features

The optional Patina gem provides extensions and concrete implementations of the Bronze application tools and patterns.
